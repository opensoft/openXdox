"""The one command an engineer runs after `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

    git clone --recurse-submodules <assembly-root-url>
    cd <Project>
    make bootstrap          # or: python3 scripts/bootstrap.py

WHAT IT DOES, in order:

  (a) MOVES EACH LEG OFF DETACHED HEAD WITHOUT MOVING THE PIN. A fresh
      recursive clone leaves every submodule detached at the pinned commit —
      the thing that makes people hate submodules, and the first thing an
      engineer meets on day one. Bootstrap creates the tracking branch AT the
      pinned commit, so the WORKING state is branch-shaped while the RECORDED
      state stays an exact pin. It never advances the pin and it never moves a
      branch that already exists somewhere else; when the pin and a branch tip
      disagree it prints both and leaves them alone. Advancing a pin remains an
      explicit commit in this repository — see `README.md`, "The lockstep
      invariant". This is why `.gitmodules` carries no `branch=`: that would
      buy the same ergonomics by weakening the pin, and then "what commit is
      this project" would have two answers.

  (b) RUNS THE NEUTRAL VALIDATORS — naming, manifest, lockstep pins. These are
      the only ones a fork with no review lane and no wallet register has, and
      they are enough: a project with no overlays is fully conformant. It then
      prints ONE line if this machine can tell OFFLINE that the upstream shape
      has moved past the pinned commit — see `shape_upstream_notice`, which
      adds no network call and is silent when it cannot answer.

  (c) READS A WALLET REVIEW-AUTHORITY REGISTER IF ONE EXISTS, and prints the
      grants whose objects name this project. If none is found it prints
      exactly `authority is not wallet-carried in this org` and CONTINUES. The
      readout degrades; it never fails. An organisation that has not adopted
      wallet-carried authority is not misconfigured, and a bootstrap that
      failed there would have made the layout load-bearing again.

  (d) EXITS 0 unless a validator failed.

SCHEMA-NEUTRAL BY CONTRACT. A one-repository project runs the same command:
step (a) is a no-op where there are no submodules, and steps (c) and (d) are
unchanged. A bootstrap that existed only for electing projects would make the
election worth something operationally, which is exactly what the ratified
doctrine forbids.
